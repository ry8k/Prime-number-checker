# Prime Number Checker ðŸŸ¢

This Python script checks whether a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

## How it Works:
1. The user is prompted to enter a number.
2. The `prime_checker` function evaluates if the number is prime by checking divisibility.
3. It prints the result: either "It's a prime number." or "It's not a prime number." 

## Usage:
- Just run the script and input a number when prompted! 

## Notes:
- Ensure the input is a positive integer greater than 1 for accurate results. 

Happy coding! ðŸš€
